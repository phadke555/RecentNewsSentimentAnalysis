# Recent News Sentiment Analysis
This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on recent news articles. The code, written in Python, utilizes the GoogleNews and newspaper3k libraries, along with NLTK, to collect news related to a user-inputted company and analyze the sentiment. The results are visualized using a pie chart and a word cloud.

### Task Overview
The goal of this project is to gather recent news articles about a specific company and analyze the sentiment expressed in those articles. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, we aim to gain insights into the overall sentiment associated with the company's news coverage. The sentiment analysis is conducted using the NLTK library, and the results are visualized using a pie chart and a word cloud.

### Libraries Used
To accomplish the task, we utilized the following libraries:

- GoogleNews: This library provides a simple interface to fetch news articles from Google News based on user-defined keywords.
- newspaper3k: This library is used for web scraping and extracting text content from news articles.
- NLTK: The Natural Language Toolkit is a powerful library for natural language processing tasks, including sentiment analysis.
- Matplotlib: This library is employed to create visualizations, such as the pie chart, to represent sentiment proportions.
- WordCloud: The WordCloud library enables us to generate visually appealing word clouds based on the frequency of words in the news articles.
